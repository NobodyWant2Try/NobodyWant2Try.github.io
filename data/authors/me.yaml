bio: "Hi, I'm an undergraduate at Peking University, specifically within the School of EECS, where I major in Intelligent Science and Technology. I have a strong passion for Computer Vision, Multimodal LLMs, and Embodied AI. After exploring 3D Gaussian Splatting and reconstruction techniques, I have recently shifted my focus to Embodied AI, multimodality, and Reinforcement Learning. I'm always open to discussing ideas with like-minded people—feel free to reach out and connect!\n"
